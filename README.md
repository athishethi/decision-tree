# decision-tree
ecision Trees are supervised machine learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we focus on classification by training a model that learns decision rules from the input features to predict the target variable.  🧠 Key Features  ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  ✔️ Data Cleaning &amp; Preprocessing
